Design and Simulation of Double Metal Ge-pocket Double Gate TFET as LIF Neurons.

Here,we're simulating the DG-TFET as LIF Neurons because it has better performance than its counter part i.e. MOSFET like it has low subthreshold swing and it works on Band to Band Tunneling so Short channel effects would not be there.
The silicon based Ge-pocket Double Gate tunnel field effect transistor (DG-TFET) demonstrates artificial neuromorphic property for leaky-integrate-fire (LIF) neurons.
DG-TFET based LIF neuron is a potential solution for implementing large-scale spiking neural networks (SNN) because of its compact circuitry and better efficiency.

In DG-TFET metal electrodes are used for source and drain terminals are chosen to induce n+ drain and p+ source in the intrinsic silicon film to realize the p+-i-n+ structure.

############LIF(Leaky Integrate Fire) Neurons--------------------------
LIF neurons mimic natural neurons, guiding the development of artificial systems for advanced cognitive tasks, mirroring the human brain.
Dendrites, serving as receptive branches in LIF neurons, gather and transmit impulses, while the connections to the cell body, analogous to synaptic weights, influence the neuron's response, reflecting the role of synapses in biological neurons.
Synaptic weights in LIF neurons determine connection strength, mimicking biological synapses in signal transmission.
Artificial neurons, inspired by LIF neurons, employ algorithms for signal integration, resembling the summation process from dendrites to the cell body, mirroring the biological activation state.
