Design and Simulation of Double Metal Ge-pocket Double Gate TFET as LIF Neurons.

Here,we're simulating the DG-TFET as LIF Neurons because it has better performance than its counter part i.e. MOSFET like it has low subthreshold swing and it works on Band to Band Tunneling so Short channel effects would not be there.
